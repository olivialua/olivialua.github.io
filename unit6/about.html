			Since we opened in March of 1998 we have strived to be local in every way--a product of its place, dedicated to local farmers and local tastes, local vendors and local artisans, local community and local people.<br><br>
All of our vegetables and fruit, all of our meat and fish, all of our dairy and eggs, all of our olive oil and rice, all of our wine and beer are sourced from the astounding bounty of California.<br><br>

We can't wait to cook for you and have you at our mesa!</p>

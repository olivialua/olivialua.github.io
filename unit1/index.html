 	<h1>About Me</h1>
 	<p>I used to live and work in New York City.  A few years ago my husband's job brought us to San Francisco.  I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I am looking to change careers and have always had an interest in web design. Taking this class is my first step in figuring out if Web Design/Development is a good fit for me.</p>

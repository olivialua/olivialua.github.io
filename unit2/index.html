		<h1>Unit 2: Design Challenge<h1>
		<h2>1. Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter.com</a></li><br>
			<li><strong><a href="http://www.windowsofnewyork.com/#top">Windows of New York.com</a></li>
		</ul>
			<h2>2. How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
			<p>Kickstarter is one of my favorite sites out there.  The viewer is immediately drawn in by its strong focal point; the use of video as a hero image.  The size of the hero image draws the viewer's attention to importance of the content found on it. (How to bring creative projects to Life)
The site uses negative space, below the fold, to draw the viewer to content that is "popular," or important.  This is a very balanced site, visually, and flows nicely.  The viewer is not overwhelmed with too much content but rather is given enough information to navigate through the site.  The site also uses hierarchy nicely as it places the most important content at the top of the index page and the other content below the fold.<br>

Kickstarter could benefit from using size to highlight some of the content found on the homepage.  Specifically, the "Discover" and "Start" tabs.<br>
Windows of New York is another one of my favorite sites.  Upon arriving on the site, the viewer is immediately drawn to the focal point - "Windows of New York" - informing the viewer of what one might expect to find on the site. The site is very balanced.  The use of positive space and size give the viewer the impression that the content found on the page is of equal importance.  Because of the great use of flow the viewer intuitively knows to scroll below the fold to find additional content.<br>
Windows could benefit from using - actually, I don't think it could benefit from much.  This is a beautiful site and I can't imagine improving it in anyway.</p>
<h2>3. What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>Kickstarter and Windows of New York are similar in their use of a strong focal point and in their balance.  Both sites also use size to highlight important content and to provide the viewer with an understanding of how to flow or navigate through the sites.<br>

The sites are different in that Kickstarter uses more negative space to highlight content while Windows of New York uses positive space to emphasize its content.</p>
<h2>4. Thumbnail sketches</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Index thumbnail sketch</li>
<img src="images/homepage.jpg">
<p>The home page for "Buy My Glasses" will draw viewer's in with its focal point, a large, alternating image of the products they can purchase on the site.  Hierarchy is important on this page as the sole purpose is to drive the viwer to purchse something on the site.</p>
